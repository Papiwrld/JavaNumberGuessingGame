## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user selects a difficulty level:
   - **Easy**: 1 to 50
   - **Medium**: 1 to 100
   - **Hard**: 1 to 200
2. A random number is generated in the chosen range.
3. The player is given up to 10 attempts to guess the correct number.
4. The app provides feedback: _Too High_, _Too Low_, or _Correct!_
5. After finishing a round, the user can play again.
